### Installation
After downloading this repository, go into the folder of this project. Then run npm install or i. 

### Usage
Make sure to have MongoDB installed. Then you can use run npm run seed to load the database, then run npm watch to run nodemon or run npm start to just run the server.js if there are no updates expected to be made. You can open Insomnia Core to enter any route create in the /routes/api directory. Using GET,POST,PUT and DELETE functions of Insomnia you can view and update the database. You can also use a program such as ROBO 3T to view the MongoDB collection.

You can also visit the Heroku link above to see the deployed site. Site will track transactions offline and then upload them to transaction history when online.

## Description
 This project was started with a functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was created using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It allows users to search and save books. This was a great way to learn about a MERN stack application and learning how to deploy it to Heroku. For future version, I would like to update the homepage.
